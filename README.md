# Chronic Diseases and Air Quality
An examination of the effect poor air quality has on chronic diseases.

# Data Overview
The CDC Annual State-Level U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (“condensed_cdi.csv”) was generated via the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which is the nation's premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collects sample data to represent state-level prevalence rates in the US.
The CDC Daily Census-Tract PM2.5 Concentrations dataset ("pm2.csv") provides modeled predictions of PM2.5 levels from the EPA's Downscaler model. This data is at the census tract level and covers the time period of 2011-2014, and it is used by the CDC's National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network to generate air quality measures.
The data from the US Energy Census and Economic Data set came from the US Energy Information Administration to report the states' coal consumptions over the years ("coal_consumption.csv").

# Questions of interest
1. At the U.S. state-level, do higher levels of PM2.5 cause higher COPD rates when controlling for Tobacco usage as a confounding factor?
2. At state level, are the average annual rates of lung cancer incidence different for people of a certain race as compared to another race?
